# Fractal-Viewer-Re-Write
Fractal Viewer V2 in early stage

An update for (https://github.com/DaveK2301/Fractal-Viewer-Original).

This code was written after my recent Bachelors and Masters degress in CSS. Is being coded with code-checker plugins in Eclipse, up to more modern standards. It has been multi-threaded. Swing Workers are used in the code demo, but different threading is being tested. It is still very much in progress and incomplete, but the OO heirarchy and class structure has been cleaned up significantly from the original version. Mathematical objects, graphical elements, and GUI elements have been moved to their own packages. GUI work is next stage.

This is purely intended as a code sample for prospective employers or partners at this time.
